/**
 * Initializes characters within a game, placing them at random locations on the game map and adding them to the scene.
 * This function randomly positions key game characters—Tom, a dog, and Jerry's friends—on the game map. Each character is
 * given a starting location that does not overlap with others, ensuring they are placed on empty tiles within the game world.
 * After positioning, the characters' game objects are added to the scene for rendering. The function also sets the initial
 * active camera to provide an overview of the map, focusing on the game space where the characters are situated.
 *
 * @param {Object} gameMap - An object representing the game map, which should provide a mechanism to get random empty tiles
 *                           (via `gameMap.graph.getRandomEmptyTile()`) and to convert tile positions to world space coordinates
 *                           (via `gameMap.localize(tile)`).
 * @param {Object} tom - The character object for Tom, which must have a `location` property for positioning and a `gameObject`
 *                       property to add to the scene.
 * @param {Object} dog - The character object for the dog, similar in structure to the `tom` object.
 * @param {Array} jerryFriends - An array of character objects for Jerry's friends, each with `location` and `gameObject` properties
 *                               like `tom` and `dog`.
 * @param {THREE.Scene} scene - The THREE.js scene to which the character objects will be added.
 * @param {THREE.Camera} mapCamera - The camera that provides an overview of the entire game map. This is set as the active camera
 *                                   at the end of character initialization.
 * @param {THREE.Camera} activeCamera - A reference to the currently active camera. This function sets it to `mapCamera`.
